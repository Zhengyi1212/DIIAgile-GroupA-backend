## First time to access to repository:
1. git init 
2. git remote add origin url, note that u have a local branch master and remote branch main
3. git pull origin main

## When u start writing code next time:
1. git fetch origin
2. resolve conflit by adding or deleting code

## When u done coding ur work
1. git add .
2. git commit -m "write what u have done here"
3. git push origin master  

NB. master is the develop branch!!! But main is the authority branch.
    So push to master so i can review at repositroy, but pull from main so u get up to date correct code.
