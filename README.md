# Working principleï¼š

## First time to access to repository:
1. git init 
2. git remote add origin url, note that u have a local branch master and remote branch main
3. git pull origin main

## When u start writing code next time, you need to get code from main to sync:
1. git fetch origin
2. git checkout master
3. git merge main
4. resolve conflit by adding or deleting code

## When u done coding ur work
1. git add .
2. git commit -m "write what u have done here"
3. git push origin master  (note here push to master, cuz master is the working branch)

NB. master is the develop branch!!! But main is the authority branch.
    So push to master so i can review at repositroy, but pull from main so u get up to date correct code.
